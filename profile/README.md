# Circles-1

Circles-1 is an open-ended ecosystem designed to integrate various personal projects and tools into one unified platform. While it currently supports a sophisticated trading system, the project is not limited to trading alone. It also encompasses home projects, everyday productivity tools, and a personal cloud solution that adapts to evolving needs.

- **Everyday Tools:** Applications designed to simplify daily tasks and enhance productivity.

The project's modular design allows for independent development of each component, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

## Project Components

- **Trading System:** A platform for executing and managing trades, integrating market data analysis.
- **Personal Cloud:** Tools and services for managing personal data, files, and applications securely.
- **Home Projects:** Automation scripts and applications for smart home setups and DIY projects.
- **Productivity Tools:** A collection of utilities to improve workflow and manage daily tasks.

## Features

- **Modularity:** Each component functions as a standalone module, allowing easy updates and independent deployments.
- **Scalability:** Built with growth in mind to accommodate new features and integrate additional systems.
- **Integration:** Seamless interconnection between modules, fostering a unified user experience.
- **Security:** Emphasis on secure practices across all components, especially in the trading and cloud domains.

## Logging Standards

Logging is a critical aspect of Circles-1, ensuring that all components can be monitored, debugged, and analyzed efficiently. To maintain consistency, all logs follow a standardized JSON schema.

### Common Log Schema

Every log entry should include the following fields:

- **timestamp**: The time the log entry was created (in ISO8601 or epoch format).
- **log_level**: The severity level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR).
- **service**: The name of the service or component (e.g., `trading_system`, `personal_cloud`, `home_projects`).
- **message**: A brief description of the event.
- **request_id**: A unique identifier to trace related events across the system.
- **environment**: The deployment environment (e.g., production, staging, development).
- **extra**: Any additional contextual information.

Example JSON log entry:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-03-28T14:22:00Z",
  "log_level": "INFO",
  "service": "trading_system",
  "message": "Market data received",
  "request_id": "abc123",
  "environment": "production",
  "extra": {
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "price": 145.67
  }
}
